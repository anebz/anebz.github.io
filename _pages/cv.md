Education
------

* **M.Sc. in Computational linguistics** \| 2018-2020 (expected) \| LMU, Germany
  * Project to determine the semantic similarity between two documents from an input of 1.3k docs on a corpus of 58k words. Generation of semantic features of all docs in 32s, comparison of documents in 5s.
  * Implementation of an (in-)sincere question classifier with pre-trained embeddings on a BiLSTM model with Attention on a 1.3M question input with 94%-6% imbalance. F1-score of 0.66. 

* **B.Sc. in Telecommunication Systems Engineering** \| 2013-2017 \| Tecnun - Universidad de Navarra, Spain
  * Project to determine the highest-scoring combination of letters in a Boggle board that yields a given hash. An error of one letter is allowed and the algorithm runs in under 0.1s.
  * Bachelor thesis: implementation of a traceability processing algorithm with high recursivity in 8MB input csv files producing ~900MB files. Programmed in Scala to use RDDs and run in an AWS EMR. 


Work experience
------

* **Student job: deep learning** \| 2018/12 - 2019/02 \| Terraloupe, Germany
  * Testing of semantic segmentation models with different preprocessing on gcloud.
* **Data scientist** \| 2018 Summer \| Skootik, Spain
  * Implementation of a multiclass image classifier from scratch focused on high class imbalance and a small dataset.
  * Image processing with cv2, CNN on Keras and F1-score of 0.7 on 5 classes across 4k images. 
* **Research assistant** \| 2017/07 - 2018/07 \| Fraunhofer IIS, Germany
  * Development, optimization and testing of a psychoacoustic model for the MPEG-H 3D Audio encoder.
  * Publication of *"Improved psychoacoustic model for efficient perceptual audio codecs"* in AES New York 2018.

Projects
------

* 2019 \| **Gendered pronoun resolution**
  * Implementation of a coreference resolution algorithm with pre-trained embeddings on a Multi-CNN/BERT model on a 4k input text from the Google GAP dataset.
