Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905). Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any progress.

I'm currently studying a [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich. I finished my first semester and now I'm enjoying the Semesterferien by sleeping, eating and making progress on my side projects.

One of those includes [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt), where I'm participating in the [Gendered pronoun resolution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gendered-pronoun-resolution) competition and exploring pretrained embeddings and the BERT model.

In my free time, I like to ride my bike, read all kinds of books and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions.
