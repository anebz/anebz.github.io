Kaixo! Welcome to my website. After a long time, I finally got to have the webpage in [dark mode](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905).

I'm currently finishing my [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich. My most recent [project](https://github.com/anebz/eu-sim) is exploring the semantic similarity between contextual embeddings. This semester I'm doing my Master Thesis, and I can confirm writing it is a tedious task.

I'm trying to improve my algorithm and data structure skills, I bought [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and I'm [working my way around it](https://github.com/anebz/ctci). I also try to read at least one academic paper per week and learn front-end on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

In my free time, I like to ride my bike, read all kinds of books and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions. My latest hobbies are bouldering and playing the transverse flute.
