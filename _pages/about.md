Kaixo! I work at [Beck et al.](https://www.becketal.com/) as a Junior DevOps Engineer, where I work with AWS, infrastructure as code, MLOps, Kubernetes and Terraform.

I did my Masters degree in NLP at [LMU Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html). My master thesis was on *The effects of word segmentation quality on word alignments*, the code and thesis document are available at [Github](https://github.com/anebz/thesis).

### Research

* I'm collaborating with my thesis supervisor on an extended version of my master thesis, with an expected publcation 2021
* I'm also involved in an NLP project about detecting sarcastic tweets in Spanish

### Reading and writing

* I regularly read deep learning and NLP papers, which I document in my curated [papers repo](https://github.com/anebz/papers).
* Blog: I post tutorials and learning in [Medium](https://medium.com/@anebz) quite often.

### Personal projects

* Telegram flashcard bot, using MongoDB and deployed on Heroku.
* Bouldering gym occupancy tracker, to check if your gym is full and you should postpone your visit to some other time. I'm working on an automated pipeline, so the data is tracked, analyzed and shown in the front-end automatically. The project is part data analysis and part DevOps. Check out the [Alpha demo](http://bouldergym.herokuapp.com/).

### Free time

* Lots of books (tracked in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6706929-ane))
* Long walks and long bicycle tours
* Traverse flute
* Synthwave music
* Bouldering
* Chess
* Sushi
