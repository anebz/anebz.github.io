Kaixo! Welcome to my website. After a long time, I finally got to have the webpage in [dark mode](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905).

I recently started at [Beck et al.](https://www.becketal.com/) as a Junior DevOps Engineer, where I'm learning about cloud and AWS in particular.

I finished my [Masters degree in NLP](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich some months ago. My master thesis is called *The effects of word segmentation quality on word alignments*, and the code and thesis document are available at [Github](https://github.com/anebz/thesis/).

I try to improve my algorithm and data structure skills by doing algorithm exercises from coding books or coding competition websites. I also have some projects going on, such as a Telegram bot to learn flashcards, useful when you are learning a language, and a Bouldering gym occupancy tracker, to check if your gym is full and you should postpone your visit to some other time.

In my free time, I like to ride my bike, read all kinds of books and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions. My latest hobbies are bouldering, playing the transverse flute and eating sushi.
