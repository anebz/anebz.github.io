Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905). Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any progress.

I'm currently studying a [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich. I bought [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and it's [more fun](https://github.com/anebz/ctci) than I'd had expected!

I'm also participating in the [Gendered pronoun resolution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gendered-pronoun-resolution) competition and exploring pretrained embeddings and the BERT model.

In my free time, I like to ride my bike, read all kinds of books and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions. Also, sleep is underrated.
