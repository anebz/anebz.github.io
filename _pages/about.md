Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905).

I'm currently studying [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) at LMU in Munich. I'm in the first semester of the 2 year program and due to my near-zero knowledge of linguistics, I'm taking advantage of winter, the cold and the short days to catch up with my linguist classmates. 

I like to ride my bike, although I'm putting on more clothes every week and I'm not sure it's as much fun when it's -5ยบ outside. I also like to [read all kinds of books](https://www.goodreads.com/anebz) and embracing my hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions.

[to be continued]
