Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905). Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any progress.

I'm currently studying a [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) degree at LMU in Munich. I'm in the end of the first semester so heavily focused on the exams. I also got a student job at Terraloupe!

I spend a fair amount of time in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt), where I'm participating in the  [Quora insincere questions classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) with modest results (top 58%). 

I like to ride my bike, although it's not so much fun to "go for a ride" when it's snowing/very cold. I also like to [read all kinds of books](https://www.goodreads.com/anebz) and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions. I'm having trouble picking up the meetup events I want to go to because there are so many!
