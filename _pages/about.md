Kaixo! Welcome to my website. First of all, apologies to your retinas because of the light mode. I'm [working on it](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137#issuecomment-439449905).

I'm currently studying [M.Sc Computational linguistics](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/studienfaecher/computerl_/master2/index.html) at LMU in Munich. I'm in the first semester of the 2 year program and due to my near-zero knowledge of linguistics, I'm taking advantage of winter, the cold and the short days to catch up with my linguist classmates. 

I spend a fair amount of time in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt), where I've explored and implemented many diverse datasets and kernels about multiclass image classification using CNNs and Keras, and soon I'll be moving on to object detection and semantic segmentation. Regarding NLP, I'm participating in the [Quora insincere questions classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).

I like to ride my bike, although it's getting colder every week and I'm not sure it's as much fun to "go for a ride" when it's snowing. I also like to [read all kinds of books](https://www.goodreads.com/anebz) and embrace my ever-growing hipster side by exploring Munich and its culinary attractions.

[to be continued]
