When I learnt Coding and Information Theory on the last year of my Bachelor degree, I was mesmerized by the compression algorithms and I wanted to check a) that they really worked, and b) if I could implement it. This idea was combined of my interest in learning python at the time (end 2016), so a classmate and I set out to build a [Huffman text compressor](https://github.com/anebz/compressor). We learnt about string manipulation, text processing, building a python GUI, the *big* difference between learning about an algorithm in class and actually implementing it, and dealing with all kinds of unforeseen problems. We realized that, indeed, it did work.
