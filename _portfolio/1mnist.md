In my summer job on 2018 I researched CNNs for image classification extensively and I decided to create a detailed explanatory notebook on my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/anebzt/mnist-with-cnn-in-keras-detailed-explanation) with what I had learnt in the process, advice on hyperparameter tuning, failures and successes, what works best in each case based on my experience... and hoping to make the steep curve smoother to beginners. I referenced insightful code snippets from other kernels and included detailed explanations aimed at people implementing a classification model for the first time. At the time of writing, it has been forked 63 times.
